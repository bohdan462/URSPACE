                        <li>Celebrate small victories and milestones in your projects</li>
                        <li>Seek support from mentors or peers when facing difficult problems</li>

                    <h2>Embrace Collaboration</h2>
                    <p>Software development is often a team effort. To improve your collaboration skills:</p>
